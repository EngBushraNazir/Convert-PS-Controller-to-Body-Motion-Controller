# Convert-PS-Controller-to-Body-Motion-Controller
This project demonstrates how a standard PlayStation controller can be modified to respond to **real body movements** like punches and kicks using motion sensors, instead of traditional button presses.

---

##  Components Used

- **MPU6050** – 6-axis motion sensor (acceleration + gyroscope)
- **Arduino Nano** – Reads sensor data and sends via Bluetooth
- **CH-05 Bluetooth Module** – Wireless communication
- **Arduino Uno** – Receives signals and triggers button actions
- **Solenoids** – Mechanically press controller buttons
- **PS4 Controller** – Game interface

## Status

-  Project concept designed  
-  Components and sensors selected  
-  Circuit and block diagram created  
-  Code not implemented yet (to be added later)

---

## Notes

- This project was initially submitted as part of an engineering assignment at IIUI.
- Inspired by the idea of making games like **Tekken** more immersive using real-life motion.
